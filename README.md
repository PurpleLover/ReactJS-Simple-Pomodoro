# Simplized Pomodoro App
Contain simplized ReactJS Pomodoro App. No external library.
Check resource in the `/src/App.js`.
As the name stated, the app is less styled, you can add as much as you can.

# Changes at July 31, 2018
Pomodoro still simplized, but moved to `/src/Pomodoro Clock`
As you can see, these are similiar to challenge of FreeCodeCamp, there is also Random Quote Machine, Calculator and Drum Machine (on-building)
Also a Form Validator, which I clone from thegioididong form check.
